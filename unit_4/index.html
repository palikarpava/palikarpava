    	<p>One of the ways people see cats as demanding creatures is the way they closely monitor us for signs of wakefulness, first thing in the morning. </p>

        	<h2>Serious talk about cats</h2>
        	<p>Imagine we have a wonderful life companion… lots of fun and always doing enjoyable things with us. They sleep 15 hours at a stretch, instead of our 8 or 9 hours. We’d do a good bit of waiting around, too. Our cat’s energy cycle is much faster than ours. They recharge more often, for a shorter stretch of time. It can be exasperating for us to see our cats napping when our own energy is at its highest. </p>
        	<p> But cats can find us equally exasperating. When we realize cats are dawn & dusk hunters, we begin to glimpse the huge adjustment our cats make to be able to spend time with us. When we see them sleeping during the day, that is their biologically proper time to do so. When they are up first thing in the morning, that is also their hunting pattern at work. The big eyes do more than make them cute.

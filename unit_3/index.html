          <h3>Form Leadership</h3>
          <p>How would I know what I want if you will not tell me about it? People no longer just want things, they want to be a part of something meaningful, today's public stand by ideas, unite for ideological events, discuss various objects by expressing what's in their minds and hearts. If there were no opinion at all, there would be one car, 1 type dress attire, one phone, etc. People seek beyond basics: the fundamental need for shelter, food, and clothing that drove us for centuries, as the audience your users want their voices matter. When it comes to the consumer market, we buy the idea of success with the new shirt and a tie, notion of uniqueness with getting Apple product, etc. Pnyx gives you an opportunity to penetrate most exciting subjects, invite people to discussions and share valuable ideas with them. You can ask users to form attitudes, encourage other people to participate and re up awareness among the audience. Just remember to use Pnyx with great wisdom in mind.</p>
